monthlyWB(
  AWC,
  PPT,
  PET,
  S_init = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{AWC}{numeric, available water-holding capacity (mm), typically thickness (mm) * awc (fraction)}

\item{PPT}{numeric, time-series of monthly PPT (mm), calendar year ordering}

\item{PET}{numeric, time-series of monthly PET (mm), calendar year ordering}

\item{S_init}{numeric, initial fraction of \code{AWC} filled with water (values 0-1)}

\item{starting_month}{integer, starting month index, 1=January, 9=September}

\item{rep}{integer, number of cycles to run water balance}

\item{keep_last}{logical, keep only the last iteration of the water balance}

\item{distribute}{logical, distribute monthly data into \code{k} divisions within each month}

\item{method}{method for distributing PPT and PET into \code{k} divisions:
\itemize{
\item 'equal' divides PPT and PET into \code{k} equal amounts
\item 'random' divides PPT and PET into random proportions generated via multinominal simulation
\item 'gaussian' divides PPT and PET according to a bell-shaped curve centered in the middle of each month
}}

\item{k}{integer, number of divisions}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} with the following elements:

\itemize{
\item{PPT: }{monthly PPT (mm)}
\item{PET: }{monthly PET (mm)}
\item{U: }{monthly surplus (mm)}
\item{S: }{monthly soil moisture storage (mm)}
\item{ET: }{monthly AET (mm)}
\item{D: }{monthly deficit (mm)}
\item{month: }{month number}
\item{mo: }{month label}
}
}
\description{
Perform a monthly water balance by "leaky bucket" model, inspired by code from \code{bucket.sim} of \code{hydromad} package, as defined in Bai et al., (2009) (model "SMA_S1"). The plant available water-holding storage (soil thickness * awc) is used as the "bucket capacity". All water in excess of this capacity is lumped into a single "surplus" term.

\details{
See the \href{http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/sharpshootR/monthly-WB.html}{monthly water balance tutorial} for further examples and discussion.

A number of important assumptions are made by this style of water balance modeling:
\itemize{
\item the concept of field capacity is built into the specified bucket size
\item the influence of aquitards or local terrain cannot be integrated into this model
\item interception is not used in this model
}
